      <description>Setup The TRACTION Pre Recorded Content Adaptation Algorithm is deployed within the dash.js reference player under /PreRecordedContentAdaptation/src/streaming/rules/abr. The file containing the algorithm&amp;rsquo;s logic is PadaRule.js.
To use the Pre-Recorded Content Adaptation Algorithm, first you need to create a video element on your html file. Make sure the controls attribute is present.
&amp;lt;video id=&amp;#34;videoPlayer&amp;#34; controls&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/video&amp;gt; Add dash.all.min.js to the end of the body.
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;script src=&amp;#34;yourPathToDash/dash.all.min.js&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt; Now, create a MediaPlayer and initialise it.</description>

      <description>Description The Pre-Recorded Content Adaptation solution contains a DASH-based 2D web player and a novel audio-prioritised adaptation solution for 2D content streaming.
The Pre-Recorded Content Adaptation Algorithm for the TRACTION EU-project is used to select the appropriate bitrates during on-demand content streaming to guarantee viewersâ€™ good QoE. It considers differents parameters such as bandwidth, buffer level, quality variation, and stream priority. It tries to ensure the highest bitrate for audio, a key feature for performing arts pieces (opera in particular), while adapting the video quality given the bandwidth constraints.</description>
