## Description

The Pre-Recorded Content Adaptation solution contains a DASH-based 2D web player and a novel audio-prioritised adaptation solution for 2D content streaming.

The Pre-Recorded Content Adaptation Algorithm for the TRACTION EU-project is used to select the appropriate bitrates during on-demand content streaming to guarantee viewersâ€™ good QoE. It considers differents parameters such as bandwidth, buffer level, quality variation, and stream priority. It tries to ensure the highest bitrate for audio, a key feature for performing arts pieces (opera in particular), while adapting the video quality given the bandwidth constraints. This is because many studies have shown that ensuring high audio quality can have a positive impact on viewers' QoE.
