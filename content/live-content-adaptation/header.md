## Description

The Live Content Adaptation solution contains a Web-RTC web player with adaptation of multiple real-time 2D video streams.

The Live Content Adaptation Algorithm for the TRACTION EU-project is used to select the appropriate video resolution and bitrates during live content streaming to guarantee viewersâ€™ good QoE. The algorithm considers different network condition parameters such as bandwidth, packet loss, and jitter. Further, the algorithm tries to ensure the highest bitrate for audio, this is a key feature for performing and viewing opera arts pieces, while adapting the video quality given the bandwidth constraints. This is because many studies have shown that ensuring high audio quality can have a positive impact on viewers' QoE.
